/**
 * Problem Description:
 * -------------------
 * The Hanoi Tower is a mathematical puzzle involving three pegs and a set of disks of different sizes.
 * The objective is to move an entire stack of disks from one peg to another, following these strict rules:
 * 1. Only one disk can be moved at a time
 * 2. Each disk is moved from one peg to another
 * 3. No larger disk can be placed on top of a smaller disk
 * The minimum number of moves required is 2^n - 1, where n is the number of disks.
 * 
 * Historical Context:
 * ------------------
 * The problem was first introduced by French mathematician Ã‰douard Lucas in 1883.
 * Lucas was inspired by a fictional legend of a temple in Hanoi, Vietnam, where monks move 64 golden disks 
 * between three pegs, following the same rules. According to the legend, when the monks complete 
 * moving all 64 disks, the world will end. This mythical puzzle would require 2^64 - 1 moves, 
 * which would take approximately 585 billion years to complete.
 * 
 * Implementation Notes:
 * --------------------
 * again too lazy to add tests and stuff, why do you need tests here anyway?
 * this is smth that i feel like doesnt have a better way of doing or needs tests so yea
